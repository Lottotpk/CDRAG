    "retrieved_context": "name: Clouds\ntype: Natural Phenomenon\ndescription: Clouds are visible masses of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere, formed through various processes involving temperature, humidity, and air currents. name: different types of clouds\ntype: Cloud Type\ndescription: Different types of clouds, such as cumulus, stratus, and cirrus, are formed through the interaction of various meteorological factors. name: Stratus Clouds\ntype: Cloud Type\ndescription: Low-lying clouds that form in a more uniform layer across the sky, often gray and can bring overcast skies and light rain. name: cloud formation\ntype: Atmospheric Process\ndescription: Cloud formation is a complex process involving the interaction of various factors such as temperature, humidity, and air currents. Clouds form when warm, moist air rises and cools to its dew point. name: clouds\ntype: Atmospheric Phenomenon\ndescription: Clouds are visible accumulations of tiny water droplets or ice crystals in the atmosphere. name: Cirrus Clouds\ntype: Cloud Type\ndescription: High, wispy clouds composed of ice crystals, often seen in the sky on clear days. name: High Altitudes\ntype: Atmospheric Layer\ndescription: The upper part of the atmosphere where conditions are very cold and dry. name: Sky\ntype: Natural Phenomenon\ndescription: The sky is the atmosphere and outer space as viewed from Earth, often appearing blue during the day due to the scattering of sunlight. It serves as a canvas for various atmospheric phenomena such as clouds. name: Dew Point\ntype: Meteorological Concept\ndescription: The dew point is the temperature at which water vapor in the air begins to condense into liquid water. name: Air Currents\ntype: Environmental Factor\ndescription: Air currents are movements of air in the atmosphere, affecting the distribution and movement of clouds. name: air currents\ntype: Atmospheric Phenomenon\ndescription: Air currents are movements of air in the atmosphere. They can be horizontal (winds) or vertical (updrafts and downdrafts). name: Temperature\ntype: Environmental Factor\ndescription: Temperature is a measure of heat or cold in an environment, affecting the rate of condensation and evaporation. name: Humidity\ntype: Environmental Factor\ndescription: Humidity is the amount of water vapor present in the air, influencing cloud formation. name: Warming of Earth\"s Surface\ntype: Environmental Process\ndescription: The warming of the Earth\"s surface by the sun is a fundamental process that initiates cloud formation.",
